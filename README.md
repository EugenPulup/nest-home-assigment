## API Testing with Postman

This project includes GitHub Actions workflows for automated API testing using Postman and Newman.

### Local Testing

To run Postman tests locally using Newman:

```bash
# Start the application and database
docker-compose up -d

# Run Newman (replace with your actual collection path)
npx newman run your-collection.json
```

### GitHub Actions Setup

To enable the automated Postman tests in GitHub Actions, add the following secrets to your GitHub repository:

1. `POSTMAN_API_KEY` - Your Postman API key
2. `POSTMAN_COLLECTION_ID` - The ID of your Postman collection
3. `POSTMAN_ENVIRONMENT_ID` - The ID of your Postman environment (if applicable)

You can find these values in the Postman app:

- For the API Key: Go to your Postman account settings
- For Collection ID: View collection details and copy the ID from the URL
- For Environment ID: View environment details and copy the ID from the URL
